00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,260
The Fire Tong Bowl

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,220
A Cheerful Film by Heinrich Spoerl

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,340
Starring Heinz Rühmann

4
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:54,700
This film is in praise of schools but it is possible that the schools will not recognize it as such. - Heinrich Spoerl

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And now gentlemen, let us pay our respects.

6
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Today I buried our dear old "Pavian".

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let us not remember all that was humorous.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Actually his name was Schmitz and he was our Latin teacher.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He nourished us with Horace and Caesar,

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and we put blasting caps under his podium.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now he has rest from his bad boys.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We toast his memory.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes, to all of our old teachers.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, and when you think about it...

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I remember we had a very young P.E. teacher.

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When we wanted to irritate him...

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We reversed and changed everything that

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
old Otto Bock had set up.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
An interesting question at this point:

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why do people do this kind of thing?

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why do people play these kinds of jokes on their teachers?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Because it is so incredibly funny.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, no. Just the opposite.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But it's only funny,

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
when you are the one playing the pranks.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Living day in and day out with such boys like us...

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
would make you a little crazy.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well they probably all are a little bit crazy.

29
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Our school principal raised chickens right next to the school courtyard.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We used to feed them bread.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And we would first dip the bread in Schnapps!

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Wonderful!

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
They acted quite like humans do.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
One of them tried to sing and the others all became sentimental.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But the chicken became obtrusive

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and relieved himself in a tin can.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
At any rate we had the opportunity to

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
witness the stupefying effects of the alcohol...

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, in this sense...

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We raise our glasses and drink to...

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
our school.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
...and to our teachers.  Cheers!

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Gone but not forgotten.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hello Doctor.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well now, the men seem to be quite animated this evening.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Doctor, I believe they are telling jokes.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Obscene jokes.

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There he is.  Pfeiffer, come on over here.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The premiere lasted a long time.

50
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
How was the show?

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm glad that I was not the writer.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What kind of brew is that?

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We just got started.

54
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Feuerzangenbowle.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The devil's infernal brew.  It works something terrible on your mind.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Not for me.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And it gives you a hell of a hangover.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is it the same for you,

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
that you sometimes dream about your school days?

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,750
No.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We all do that.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I always have the same dream:

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sitting together with my boy in a school desk.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
l have forgotten everything,

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and the rascal has to give me all the answers.

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I always dream that I have forgotten my history book.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Especially on nights when I've eaten lobster.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
History book?  I've never owned one.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I never had enough money.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I spent my money drinking!

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Pfeiffer, come on now and laugh.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
About what?

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You are beyond help.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We need to get the next batch ready.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Good night. Thank you very much.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You shouldn't interrupt me.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If you put worn down chalk in ink

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
then it foams and you have...

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We had a teacher once who was a real dandy..

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
he was also near sighted.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So with him we...

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You know what we did with him?

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well come on, tell us!

84
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
A wet sponge..

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We put a wet sponge

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
on his podium chair.Now, imagine this...

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
the whole morning he sat there in his wet pants.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And do the teachers all find this funny?

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We never asked them.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Didn't you do things like this too?

91
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So this was some kind of model institution?

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
l never went to a school.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But you...

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I received my diploma through private tutors.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
l was taught by private teachers in my home

97
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
by the generosity of my father.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You were never in a school?

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well that is just terrible.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You poor, pitiful man.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then you don't know how it is.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Living in a real flop house and cramming for exams..

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
with your fellow students.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
l can imagine.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Imagine? Oh no... You have to actually experience it.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You really missed something.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I really feel sorry for him.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He missed the most wonderful part of being young.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
God knows he did. And it can't be repeated.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Cheers Pfeiffer.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Cheers Pfeiffer.

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Pardon my question but...

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Why couldn't he go back to school?

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What do you mean?

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You mean he could really go back again...

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Just for fun and only for a couple of weeks.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
As a grown man?

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come on, that's crazy

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Of course it's crazy.

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Although when you think about it purely in a theoretical sense...

123
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.  You are serious?

124
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm not sure.  I would have to seriously think about it.

125
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It would have to be somewhere where no one knows him.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That is easy.  Babenberg for example.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That is my hometown and it is in the middle of nowhere.

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
a charming little town...

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
with a charming little high school.

130
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
...and very charming...

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Girls?

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No, Teachers.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is there at least a decent hotel where he can stay?

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hotel, no way! He'll have to find a room.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes, of course, where he can do whatever he wants.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But his sweet Marion will never allow him to do it.

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
l won't ask her.

138
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What? Do you really want to?

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
God knows I have more important things toNdo.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you would permit me, your publisher...

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to say something.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Here recently you have been writing a little too much.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It is high time that you experience something.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Right! Something completely crazy.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So that you can learn to laugh.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So, what'll it be Pfeiffer? Do you have the courage to do it?

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What could possibly happen to him?

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If things got to boring for him he could just stand

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and say: "You can't do anything to me.

150
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I've got my diploma and my PhD in my briefcase.!"

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, Pfeiffer is going back to high school.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, well, if you would allow me...

153
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Nothing is allowed here.

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
...until I have expressed how I feel.

155
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When are you leaving?

156
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
l envy you.

157
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Damn it, I'd like to go too.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Man, I would kill for the chance.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Then it is clear to all of us

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
that this is of course insane...

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But Ihave always wished,

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to do something a little insane.

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
To be a regular boy.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Foolish and no worries.

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
To do homework,

166
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and to shoot paper wads,

167
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But Gentlemen,

168
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
nobody would believe me.

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
l certainly don't look like a young pupil.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You'll have to change your appearance accordingly.

171
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How?

172
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Should I perhaps

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
shave off my dear beard?

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And have my flowing, thick hair trimmed?

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Maybe also a pair of sad, nickel plated eyeglasses?

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Books under my arm, a pupil's cap on my head.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And then I'll stand...

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
one morning out on the schoolyard...

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm the new guy, the sensation for Babenberg.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And they are all coming up to me in droves...

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
amazed by me, questioning me...

182
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
who I am, where I come from, whether I...

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey, who is that?

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's the new guy.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He looks like...

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Is he supposed to be from Berlin?

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But you're here.

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How clever!

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Take your seats.

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're supposed to take a seat.

191
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You are the new pupil?

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yes sir.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Take off your cap and stand up.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
On behalf of this institution...

195
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and the upper school, I welcome you.

196
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Now, sit up front

197
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
so you can see better.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You will feel right at home here.

199
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Your name is?

200
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Doct...uhh...Jo...Johann Pfeiffer.

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
With one "f"?

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
With three.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Three "f's"?

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
One in front of the "ei", and two after it, sir.

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You are a little silly.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
So you have never been in a school?

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You gave me that impression.

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You will get used to our strict school routine.

209
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Have a seat.

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes sir.

211
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Being in school is like taking medicine,

212
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
it has to taste bad or it doesn't work.

213
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
As I have written in my own book:

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
''The duty of a teacher...

215
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
...taking into consideration...

216
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
...the institution of higher learning'...

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
taking into consideration, the institution of higher learning...

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
is primarily that he has done his part, to further scientific endeavors...

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and to see that the prescribed teaching material

220
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
has been taught.

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
First and foremost by the knowledge and the assistance of the teacher

222
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
to the students, which have been entrusted to him.

223
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
and secondly with the utmost respect

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
and highest admiration from the students...

225
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
...for their teacher.

226
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Who did that?

227
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Who did that

228
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Professor, why don't you ask Luck?

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Luck! Did you see who shot this paper wad?

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Who me?

231
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Rosen! Did you see him do it?

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I just said you should ask Luck,

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
because he is so smart..

234
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Sit down, Rosen.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You have no moral maturity.

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If the culprit does not identify himself ,

237
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I will find out who he is.

238
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Ohhh, this piece of paper has been torn out of a notebook.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Everyone come forward!

240
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Show me all of your notebooks.

241
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Professor, the bell rang.

242
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
For the next hour repeat

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
what we have gone through.

244
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Klemm, what do you need?

245
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Pfeiffer is supposed to go to the principal right away.

246
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Sir.

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Come closer, Pfeiffer.

248
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes sir.

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You have learned the school rules, Pfeiffer?

250
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They were given to me.

251
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So you know that pupils are not to visit pubs...

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
without a chaperone?

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And still you were seen just yesterday..

254
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
in the pub "Axmacher".

255
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I live there.

256
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You live there!

257
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This is starting out well.

258
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
l thought...

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You're not supposed to think.

260
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I will break the habit. Axmacher" is a...

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He is thinking again.

262
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I thought that if such noisy, fine gentlemen such as...

263
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He is still thinking.

264
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Excuse me, I...

265
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Just be quiet.

266
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't mean to say anything against the "Axmacher",

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
but that is no place for you to live.

268
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
First of all it's too costly for you

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
und secondly, what kind of impression does that make?

270
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You, a pupil at a reputable institution of higher learning.

271
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I didn't think about that.

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But you are supposed to think.

273
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
...as an educated person.

274
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
OK. Then today I'll go looking for a new pad.

275
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A pad?  What kind of expression is that?

276
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
A pad is something, well, nasty. I would almost say...

277
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
...uhh, immoral.

278
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
A student at a reputable institution of higher learning...

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
should not have a pad but rather a proper room,

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
with proper, well intentioned people.

281
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Fine, then later I'll go...

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
o! Right now.

283
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You are excused from your lessons.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, too bad.

285
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
l don't know whether or not this might be a little bit expensive for you...

286
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
65 Marks a week room and board,

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I can afford it.

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Per month, young man.

289
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What is there to eat?

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Good home cooking of course.

291
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It is substantial and nutritious.

292
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And as much as you want.

293
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm not a big eater.

294
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's necessary for children...

295
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
in the developing years.

296
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
My son also didn't want to eat properly until...

297
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
until later, when he...

298
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

299
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Bathroom? Oh, yes.

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
l have a cast iron tub.

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you would like to see it sometime...

302
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
o, thank you.

303
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Every Saturday l'll heat you

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
up some food.

305
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You should feel at home here.

306
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I could have a rocking chair set up for you here.

307
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
or maybe my piano.

308
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Thank you very much.

309
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You didn't do this very well.

310
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That could have broken.

311
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, that is definitely your mother?

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
No, no that is...

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Well then it is some other relative?

314
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Maybe an aunt?

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Something like that.

316
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Beautiful woman... and so elegant.

317
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Does she look after you?

318
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
l have to count on it.

319
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Where is Doctor Pfeiffer? Not here again?

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Doctor Pfeiffer is on vacation somewhere,

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
as has already been mentioned several times.

322
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Alfred, you are lying. He would have taken me with him.

323
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Perhaps this time he had a special reason,

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
for traveling without his dear...

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Reasons? Be honest.

326
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Who is she, what's her name and is she cute?

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Who?

328
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The other woman.

329
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He didn't take a woman with him this time.

330
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well then he must still be here.I smell cigarette smoke.

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can hardly imagine that.

332
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Here is a glass that has been used.

333
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
How could that be?

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Alfred, what is going on with you?

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You're just standing there. Well, you're drunk!

336
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Something is not right here.

337
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
All of his suitcases are still here?

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And all of his suits?

339
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He didn't even take a pair of pajamas?

340
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The poor man. How will he sleep?

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Telephone.

342
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Sweetheart! Will you please get it?

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What? Hmmm

344
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Ohhh.

345
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Well...

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Damned invention.

347
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Mr. Hans, is everything OK with you?

348
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,750
No.

349
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What would you like to have for breakfast?

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
In the morning I really require very little.

351
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Just a little something.

352
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
X is equal to negative P half plus or minus the root of P half

353
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in square minus Q the tangent one half ( Alpha plus Beta )...

354
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If the cocoa is not sweet enough for you...

355
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's fine, it's fine.

356
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
How do you like it here in Babenberg?

357
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Have you settled in well?

358
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes, yes, of course.

359
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Have you been to the Marksmen's Festival?

360
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Well, what I really wanted to say was...

361
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Don't get involved with any girls.

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
After all we live here in a city.

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Many a boy has been corrupted.

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't let me disturb you.

365
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
My son was also so diligent.

366
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Now he works with taxes. Oh well, things could be worse I guess.

367
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do you have strict teachers?

368
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hmmm. Very strict

369
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Morning boys.

370
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Morning, Professor.

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Oh, so you are the new one?

372
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You don't need to stand up. I don't require the students to stand for me.

373
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What does it benifit me if everyone stands up?

374
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Morning, Pömmel.

375
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I said 'morning', didn't I?

376
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Oh, you know, this weather today, the sun is shining...

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm in such a good mood.

378
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
We really don't want to get off on the wrong foot today .

379
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So, where were we?

380
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Today we're talking about a steam engine. What is a steam engine?

381
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
To put it quite simply a steam engine...

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
is a large, round, black chamber.

383
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And the large, round, black chamber,

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
it has two holes.

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The one hole is where the steam comes in...

386
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
and the other hole... well, we'll get to that later.

387
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
ow, what does the steam do?

388
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
The steam, it pushes on the pistons.

389
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What is a piston?  Well, that can't be explained.

390
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's in the book.

391
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What are you doing down there, Rudi?

392
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
10 Pfennig of mine fell down here.

393
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That is a lot of money for a boy.

394
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Where was I? Right, yes, the pistons.

395
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Now that is very ingenious.

396
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
This is also where the steam comes in from the other side.

397
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
and that also pushes on the pistons...

398
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
With it.

399
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,960
You pig.

400
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What will you give me for the "Mecklenburg"?

401
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Have you doubled it?

402
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
But it's not genuine.

403
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Show me.

404
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
On one end it goes back and forth,

405
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and on the other end it goes around.

406
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That is the connecting rod. Sometimes this kind of

407
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
steam engine has two cylinders.

408
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Then it's called a twin engine.

409
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This is nothing to laugh about.

410
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Are there any questions?

411
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Any questions?  So, now you all know how a steam engine works.

412
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
And if you don't know, it's your own fault.

413
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Where is my other shoe?

414
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It was just right here.

415
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
And now it's gone.

416
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Maybe you have it on.

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
No. Has one of you seen my other shoe?

418
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
When I catch the lousy student, who took my shoe!

419
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Professor, we are not stealing any shoes.

420
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Just be nice and give me my shoe back.

421
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If you do, there will be no punishment.

422
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
l am not going to give in to you.

423
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You can check our desks.

424
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
If you had some kind of idea that I was going to hop to my next class..

425
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
on one leg...

426
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
l have time.

427
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Professor, the second bell...

428
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Without my shoe I'm not going anywhere.

429
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But we have history with Doctor Brett right now.

430
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I can't change that.

431
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Anything special out there?

432
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Our sister high school.

433
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Isn't that convenient. Can you get together with any of them?

434
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
The blonde with the long locks.

435
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I like the dark headed one.  She is hot.

436
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
No, she's mine

437
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
l like the tall one.

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What about you?

439
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I like all of them.

440
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You little pig.

441
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,720
Brett!

442
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Your attention please!

443
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Good morning.

444
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Good morning.

445
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Sit down.

446
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What's going on?

447
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Pömmel.

448
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Pömmel.

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
My dear colleague, this must be a mistake.

450
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm waiting for my shoe.

451
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
What is going on here?

452
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh, Rudi, yes.

453
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
...and no tickling please.

454
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Yes, thank you.

455
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Thanks very much.

456
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Have a nice morning, sir.

457
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Here you go.

458
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Thank you, Ackerman.

459
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Gees! What a horrible character you all have.

460
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Pfeiffer.

461
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
l know.  With three "f's"

462
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Only because Mr. "Nose" asked me in such a funny way.

463
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Mr. "Nose"?

464
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I couldn't have known that...

465
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Professor Kray is his real name.

466
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You see, Pfeiffer, things are different in my class.

467
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I take care of my pupils.

468
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And I give them the choice: War or peace.

469
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This class has decided for peace,

470
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and it is going quite well that way.

471
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Other than that it is really of no use,

472
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
because I already know all of the stupid things you might try from my own childhood.

473
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So, it's not going to work with me.

474
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But what if we do something brand new?

475
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Then try it.

476
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You were supposed to look over the chapter on mass migration.

477
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So, Knebel! Tell us about it.

478
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Which tribe of people could you best speak about?

479
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
The, uhh...Goths.

480
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Then I don't need to ask you about the Goths.

481
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Then tell us something about the... Goths.

482
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
The Goths...

483
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
...were located...

484
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
...originally...

485
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Originally the Goths were located in...

486
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Knebel, step away from your desk.

487
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Originally the Goths were located in...

488
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Sweden.

489
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Right. Then from there they went to...?

490
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
From there they went to...

491
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
...uhh, near Danzig.

492
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
From there they went to...

493
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
...to Russia and from there they went to...

494
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yes, and after that they really didn't know

495
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
what they should do and uhhh...

496
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
...and they found themselves in the east where the mixed with the Western Goths.

497
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Good, Knebel. You can have a seat. "D".

498
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
How could that answer possibly be a "D"? I earned a "B".

499
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Pfeiffer gets the "B".

500
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And please give me your mirror.

501
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Here you go.

502
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You call that new?

503
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What do you do when it rains?

504
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

505
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and the playing of the trumpet.

506
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

507
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
and the playing of the trumpet.

508
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

509
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and the playing of the trumpet.

510
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
The Spring time brings a good mood

511
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Reliably every...

512
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

513
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and the playing of the trumpet.

514
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The Spring blows in...

515
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

516
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
and the playing of the...

517
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The Spring blows in good cheer..

518
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Reliably every year...

519
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

520
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
...of the...

521
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Tru- tru- trumpet.

522
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Someone is singing off key.

523
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Everything is OK here.

524
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Pfeiffer! Are you the one singing off key?

525
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Uhh... definitely not.

526
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Maybe you should come up here.

527
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Try singing this note.

528
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,000
You're singing too deep. Just listen.

529
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Ahhhhhh...

530
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
No, Pfeiffer.

531
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Now it's too high.

532
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Ahhhh...

533
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Ahhhhhhhhhh...

534
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
You're obviously tone deaf.

535
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You are of course excused from the chorus.

536
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Uhhh..  so I'm not allowed to sing anymore?

537
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Let's try it again.

538
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

539
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
and the playing of the trumpet

540
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It blows in good cheer...

541
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Reliably every year...

542
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
The Spring time loves the playing of a flute,

543
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
and the playing of the trumpet

544
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It blows in good cheer

545
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Reliably every year...

546
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
l think it steals your heart.

547
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
This proud melancholy of language.

548
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Heavenly.

549
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Magical.

550
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And he is so intelligent. You can actually have a conversation with him.

551
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,000
To whom are you saying that? He was with me for breakfast yesterday.

552
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You are so lucky.

553
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Pfeiffer has been missing from Berlin without a trace for two weeks now.

554
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
- Ladies, please move along. - Oh, it is such an experience to read his work.

555
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Read?  Oh yes, I guess one could do that sometime.

556
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You see, that is him: Pfeiffer, as he loves and lives.

557
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Elegant, beautiful, thoughtful... and so alluring.

558
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Well, can't everyone do that?

559
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
When?

560
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
The key word is Baldrian.

561
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
What? Baldrian.

562
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Who says that?

563
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
l do of course.

564
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
When I say the word "Baldrian", things start to happen.

565
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Careful, the old men are coming...

566
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Pfeiffer seems to have

567
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
settled in very well with us here.

568
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm afraid perhaps too well. Sir, do you still have class with the Upper School today?

569
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Yes, why?

570
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
l would advise you to be on guard.

571
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
If we don't bother the boys then they don't bother us.

572
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
- Do you agree with me? - Yes, but they live for such things.

573
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
The affection of our pupils can be won by other means.

574
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
l have a few effective tricks,

575
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
with which you can spice up...

576
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
your lessons and present it in a pleasant way.

577
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
ln chemistry for instance,

578
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I talk every year about the effects of alcohol.

579
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So every year I bring - and my students know this -

580
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
...a one liter bottle of huckleberry wine,

581
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
which I have made myself,

582
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
and I bring it with me to the chemistry lesson, so that each of the students

583
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
can be convinced of its pleasant taste.

584
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Careful now! Each of you just get a small swallow,

585
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
otherwise it will go to your head.

586
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh-ho-ho.

587
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Each of you must hold the glass at a 20 degree angle,

588
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
So the wine in a different position.

589
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
We will determine the alcohol content while we are doing this.

590
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
As you can see it is almost 13 percent.

591
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I picked the huckleberries myself.

592
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Huckleberry wine not only has

593
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
a pronounced and spiced taste,

594
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
but it is also healthy and very nourishing.

595
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Isn't it right to say, Professor, Baldrian...

596
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Baldrian... is supposed to be healthy as well.

597
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Of course Baldrian is healthy.

598
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
But that discussion is for some other time.

599
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You're right, Professor.

600
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
My uncle always used to say, Baldrian,

601
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Baldrian belongs in every family.

602
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You're silly. Ackermann, what do you know...

603
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
...about the effects of alcohol?

604
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Even the old Germanic tribes were making

605
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
a strong drink from honey called Meade.

606
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Without their meast they used to lie around on bear skins.

607
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What's wrong?

608
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Nothing, I just feel a little funny in the head.

609
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Then have a seat.

610
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Pfeiffer, please carry on.

611
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
The alcohol content, or rather the content of the alcohol

612
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
produces alcohol, alcohol produces content,

613
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
or the so called alcohol content.

614
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Pfeiffer, you are rambling. Sit down.

615
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The alcohol is starting to ramble,

616
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
and the result is the secret brood or the huckleberry hooch.

617
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Luck.

618
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Professor, I don't what this means but...I just can't talk anymore.

619
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What?

620
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
When alco-hole, is the only hole...

621
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What? do you feel all right?

622
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
-Sure, I feel fine... -Open the window.

623
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Rosen! Carry on.

624
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
That is laughable.

625
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But Professor,

626
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I only have to think about my poor mother.

627
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
My poor mother.

628
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
The wine ferments far away... The alcohol, the wine,

629
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
the alcohol is produced by the hucleberries in fermentation,

630
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
in fermented alcohol...

631
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Professor, I'm seeing everything in double.

632
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Professor...

633
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
...I'm going to bed.

634
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
l don't understand this.

635
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
All of this from just one little swallow.

636
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
This is just im... impossible

637
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
I would like to have a little swallow!

638
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Me too!

639
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
What is going on here?

640
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I can hear you clear over in the other wing

641
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Quiet!

642
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,720
Quiet!

643
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
l want to know what is going on here.

644
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
You little, you sweet.

645
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Yes, we drank some wine, some really good wine.

646
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Come here, sit down on the bench. We all like you so much...

647
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Ackermann! What have you been drinking?

648
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
As good Germans we have been drinking

649
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
good German wine.

650
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
And where do all of you get this wine from?

651
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
We had to drink it in Professor Kay's class.

652
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
l am completely puzzled.

653
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
If you would just try one swallow...

654
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
l don't drink.

655
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
All of you, go home, as quietly as you can.

656
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Try to pull yourselves together.

657
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And then go straight to bed.

658
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
My dear colleague, you have poisoned the entire Upper School.

659
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But I innocently wanted to show the effects of alcohol...

660
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
My wonderful Upper School...

661
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
from such a small swallow?

662
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
...poisoned I said.

663
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
l am expecting a written report from you.

664
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And furthermore there will be...

665
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
What, Pfeiffer?

666
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
l would like to...

667
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
...make a confession.

668
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
ls someone there?

669
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
No.

670
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
You?  Are you the guy with the huckleberry wine?

671
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
What do you want?

672
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
We just want to take a look.

673
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
OK, ok now, go on.

674
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
You? You're supposed to be so smart.

675
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So tell us something smart.

676
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Or would you rather have a cigarette?

677
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But you're not allowed to smoke.

678
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
It's forbidden in detention.

679
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
But we can smoke in front of you.

680
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Now he's going to get detention for smoking.

681
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,000
You're only being brave because there is a door between us.

682
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Should we come in?

683
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'd like for you to.

684
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
We're embarassing ourselves. What do you think of us?

685
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
You are all probably ugly like the night...

686
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
bowlegged simpletons, nothing up top and nothing in the rear.

687
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Nice looking girls don't get embarassed.

688
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Nice to meet you, Pfeiffer.

689
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
You're just children!

690
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
You ass!

691
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Well.

692
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Good.

693
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Oh my, oh my, oh my...

694
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Mrs. Windscheid, do you think it will work like this?

695
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
People don't like it when boys,

696
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
become so vain all of the sudden.

697
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll be back for dinner.

698
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Hi, Hans.

699
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Hi, See you, Good Bye.

700
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Where are you off to?

701
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Well, uhhh...

702
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What about the essay?

703
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
l have to go. Bye.

704
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Hiking is the miller's desire

705
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Hiking is the miller's desire

706
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,720
Hiking

707
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That must be a bad miller

708
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
who never thought of hiking

709
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
who never thought of hiking

710
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,800
Hiking...

711
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
So tell me, was it awful in detention?

712
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Quite the opposite. It was a highly interesting experience.

713
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Pfeiffer, why do you tell me so little about yourself?

714
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
What is there to tell?

715
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
What would you like to know?

716
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Everything.

717
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Have you ever been in love before?

718
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
l have always been very stand offish.

719
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
You see, that is one of the things I like about you.

720
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,000
l don't like boys who are immediately so pushy.

721
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The younger students are the worst.

722
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Really?

723
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
My girlfriend knew one,

724
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
who wanted a kiss from her.

725
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
What is it?

726
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Too bad that I'm not a younger student.

727
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Why?

728
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:28,000
DUE TO RENOVATIONS THE HIGH SCHOOL WILL BE CLOSED TODAY.

729
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
You there! What are you doing?

730
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Nothing.

731
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
You took down that sign.

732
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
No I didn't.

733
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Hang it right back up there.

734
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
What do you want me to do?

735
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Hang that sign back up, damn it.

736
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes sir.

737
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Gentlemen, I am asking for your opinion.

738
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
l agree with the opinion of the director.

739
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
But I haven't said anything yet.

740
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
My dear colleague.

741
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
l vote that the students responsible

742
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
be expelled from this school.

743
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But first we have to determine who the guilty student is.

744
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
We will appeal to their sense of duty, and ask them to tell us...

745
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
willingly who did this.

746
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I believe in our students but... so much sense of duty?

747
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Usually it is a good friend who turns the perpetrator in.

748
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Hopefully we don't have friends like this at our school.

749
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
If we don't get anywhere

750
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
then we'll have to punish them all, the old fashioned way.

751
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,000
We have 247 students at our school.

752
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
We'll be punishing 246 of them unjustly.

753
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
ln my book "the duty of a teacher...''

754
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
My dear Mr. Brandt, please wipe the smile off of your face.

755
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
The situation is serious enough.

756
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
True, but the problem lies somewhere else.

757
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
If it were to come out that this sign was a forgery, and that we all

758
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
fell for this stupid trick played on us by the boys,

759
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
we will be the laughing stock of the town.

760
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
And what will the school superintendent say?

761
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
For God's sake, what are going to do?

762
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Nothing!

763
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
What do you mean "nothing"?

764
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
This forgery...

765
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Whether the sign is a forgery or not depends completely on us.

766
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
To put it simply we'll just say:

767
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
The sign is real. We hung it out there ourselves.

768
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Because of the renovations.

769
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

770
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
This suggestion stands in the starkest contrast...

771
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
to the principles in my book and I vote against it.

772
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I for one apologize for this suggestion.

773
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
We have the highest reputation and respect in this community

774
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and for our school to be found at fault...

775
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Yes, at fault for not avoiding the blame.

776
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
And you Principal, of all people can avoid

777
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
an extremely embarrassing report to the school superintendent.

778
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Uh...hmmm...

779
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You mean, Mr. Pömmel, I need to...

780
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Yes, how do you see things working out?

781
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
We don't have any renovations going on.

782
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I can fix that for you.

783
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Kids, the meeting is over.

784
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Now the investigation begins.

785
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Well, Pfeiffer, you think you're so brave, or maybe I should say, brave with your words.

786
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Are your knees knocking a little?

787
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
If it were to come out that...

788
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
How?

789
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
I don't know. Maybe, if someone were to turn you in.

790
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Maybe you? We can't trust you?

791
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Say that again and I will turn him in.

792
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I bet you won't!

793
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You bet I would!

794
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Have a seat.

795
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Take out your books.

796
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Turn to page... Now what do you want?

797
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
l have to make an announcement.

798
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
If you're not prepared again...

799
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
l believe it to be my duty, so that no innocent person...

800
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Take care of this out on the school yard.

801
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Professor, it's got to do with the sign.

802
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Sit down.

803
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
It's got to do with the sign yesterday.

804
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Not, "it's got to do with the sign",

805
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
but rather, "it has to do with the sign."

806
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
OK, OK, has to do, got to do with... It has to do with the sign...

807
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
You need to sit down!

808
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Aren't you interested in...

809
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
If you continue you will be thrown out of this class!

810
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
who hung the sign outside...

811
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
You're talking nonsense. The maintenance crew placed the sign on the gate...

812
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
...because of the renovations.

813
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's a lie.

814
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
That will be enough! Sit down!

815
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Ackermann, write this up in the class book:

816
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Rosen disturbed the lesson with his foolish talk.

817
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Now open your books to page 117.

818
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
OK, Pfeiffer, You look so pleased with yourself.

819
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Maybe I should pick on you again today?

820
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I hope you do.

821
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Then I want to see rather or not

822
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
you understood "Wallenstein".

823
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
ln which act and in which scene...

824
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
does who say to whom these words: "That was no act of heroism...

825
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
...Octavio."

826
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Yes, Pfeiffer, you don't know, do you?

827
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
You are becoming more and more dumb.

828
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,000
You are becoming the laughing stock of the entire class.

829
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
I don't get it. ln all other subjects you are doing satisfactorily or better...

830
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
You are only failing German.

831
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,000
German...German is not my thing.

832
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
That is too bad! What do you hope to be someday?

833
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I don't know yet.

834
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Be sure and choose a profession that doesn't require much writing.

835
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
The best choice would be to become a dentist.

836
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,750
OK.

837
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Good Morning. May I help you? You would like a room?

838
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
l would like to know if, Dr. Pfeiffer lives here.

839
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
He hasn't checked in yet. In the meantime would you like to...

840
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Thank you. Where else could Dr. Pfeiffer live?

841
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Oh my, maybe... But I...

842
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Mr. Axmacher, we did have a Mr. Pfeiffer here.

843
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
The one who left the huge tip.

844
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Oh please, there is no way!

845
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
A huge tip! Where does he live?

846
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Ask over at the high school.

847
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
High School?

848
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
They are on their break right now.

849
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Where is it?

850
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Go right at the next street.

851
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Thank you.

852
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Mam, are you lost?

853
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
l am looking for a Doctor Pfeiffer, I have to urgently speak with him.

854
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Doctor Pfeiffer, no, who is that?

855
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
A teacher?

856
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I'm not sure.

857
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
We don't have a Doctor Pfeiffer.

858
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But I was told you did.

859
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Mam, unless you mean him?

860
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:50,000
He came to us a couple of weeks ago.

861
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
But he is no doctor.

862
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Could you call him in?

863
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
No, he has to go to his class.

864
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Thank you very much.

865
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Good morning boys.

866
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Morning.

867
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
We are taking a quiz today

868
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
over air pressure.

869
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Couldn't we just write about a thermometer?

870
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
We would do better at that.

871
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I don't care.  Write over whatever you want. Just no nonsense.

872
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Somebody knocked.

873
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
That joke is too old.  I won't fall for it.

874
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
...anyway, about the thermometer.

875
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Professor, someone really is knocking.

876
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
What? You think I didn't hear that?

877
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Go and see what they want.

878
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I'll ask.

879
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
There is a woman out there.

880
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
A woman?  What does she want?

881
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
To come in.

882
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
No, no, no.

883
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
How does she look?

884
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Beautiful.

885
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I'll go and look for myself.

886
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Please behave yourselves for just a moment.

887
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Yes?

888
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Could you tell me if there is a Mr. Pfeiffer in your class?

889
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Do you mean this boy here?

890
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I would like to speak with him.

891
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Well, we're taking a quiz right now.

892
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Now Professor, don't be so strict.

893
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Send him out here.

894
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
If it won't take too long.

895
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Whom shall I say is here?

896
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
He can see for himself.

897
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Yes, and what is this regarding?

898
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
That doesn't make any difference.

899
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Then I'm not interested in helping you.

900
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Professor!

901
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
He is a bit unruly and not very well behaved...

902
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
What? Him? Oh... He keeps us all in stitches.

903
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Where exactly do you know him from?

904
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
From Berlin of course.

905
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I see. You're from Berlin. Yes, you look like you are from Berlin.

906
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
You know what?  Just leave me and these boys alone.

907
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Thank you.

908
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,000
Hans, are you here? He must have just left.

909
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
In the afternoons he is always going somewhere.

910
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Can I get something for you?

911
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Oh, now I know who you are. You are his aunt.

912
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Yes, I know you from the picture hanging over there...

913
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
...which he hung over there.

914
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Did you write him that you were coming?

915
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Sometimes it's better to arrive unannounced.

916
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
A surprise. I'm sure he will be thrilled.

917
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,000
No, how young you look.

918
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yes, dear woman...

919
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,000
We notice how old we are becoming by our children.

920
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
So how is my.... my nephew doing?

921
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Great, he has become a lovely young man.

922
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Oh, well then he certainly has a little girlfriend by now?

923
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
No! What would he do with a girlfriend?

924
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
He has no time for girls.

925
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
He is only interested in his books.

926
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Oh, here he comes.

927
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Some nice, refreshing coffee.

928
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
We'll be wanting some cheesecake.

929
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Just wait. I'll pour for us.

930
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Ohh!

931
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
What?

932
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Pfeiffer, we can't tell you that you can't be here,

933
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,000
but don't you think it is a bit unusual that you are sitting here at the table next to us...

934
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Oh, well if I could sit with all of you.

935
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Of course I'd like to. I just didn't think it would be proper.

936
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Would you please introduce to me both of these ladies?

937
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
No? Nice to meet you, Pfeiffer.

938
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Nice to meet you. Pfeiffer.

939
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
The principal was so kind as to

940
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
invite me over.

941
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Well, do I really get to sit next to these precious young ladies?

942
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Mam, I don't know if

943
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
you have already heard about me.

944
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,000
l am extraordinarily pleased, to find out that you are the charming wife...

945
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
of our highly esteemed principal.

946
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh, thank you.

947
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I am even more astounded to see how..

948
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
similar you and your sister look.

949
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,000
But no, Mr. Pfeiffer, this is my little daughter.

950
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You don't say!  What do you know?

951
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
That just can't be the truth.

952
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
You already have such a grown up daughter?

953
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,000
l thought that this young woman was...

954
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
What did you think?

955
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
...would be your daughter.

956
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,000
You overestimate my age. I'm not that old.

957
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Yes, Professor, you're right.  I didn't think it through.

958
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
At the very most you are twice as old as Miss Eva.

959
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
But don't worry. In 20 years it will be a completely different mix.

960
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
You will only be 1 1/2 times as old, and in 100 years you will be... Let me do the math...

961
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Pfeiffer, if you have anything else...

962
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
...something else for today ...anything...if you were to have anything else planned...

963
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Well of course he has to finish his homework.

964
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
We'll do that in school tomorrow morning.

965
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
But if I have your permission,

966
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
even though I could talk a little bit more about myself ...

967
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
...I don't want to hold you up anymore.  It has been a real pleasure.

968
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
Of course he's not here anymore.

969
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
But we can't do our Greek...

970
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Come on, Greek? I'm sure he's got some cigarettes tucked away here somewhere.

971
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What the heck is this?

972
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
It's a hair bow.

973
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Absolutely.  You have to treat women poorly.

974
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
First I will marry...

975
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Because you have to.

976
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Your girlfriend colors her hair blonde.

977
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Can you do that?

978
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
With bleach, H2-O2.

979
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This is why I don't get chemistry.

980
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Of course there are no cigarettes.

981
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Whoah, what in the world is this?

982
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Would you two gentlemen perhaps like a cigarette from me?

983
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
You are allowed to smoke, aren't you?

984
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Who is that?

985
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Don't know. I'm sure she's waiting on Hans.

986
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
You think so?

987
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Not bad at all.

988
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
- Introduce me. - We can't do this.

989
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
- Go on! - We can't do this.

990
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
You're going to introduce me and...

991
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Gentlemen! Let's not fight.

992
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
But next time you had better knock,

993
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
when a lady is sleeping in the room.

994
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:57,000
You both could very easily put me in a compromising situation.

995
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
- Yes, of course. - Excuse us. - Please excuse us.

996
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
There is no need to be embarrassed gentlemen,

997
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
You also don't need to think about running away,

998
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Just turn around.

999
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
And since you both are acting so cute,

1000
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I will allow you to put my shoes on for me.

1001
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Ouch... but gentlemen...

1002
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Well they didn't have any more streusel so I got us some...

1003
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Ohh...Marion...?

1004
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Well, it's amazing that you still know my name.

1005
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Yes, quite amazing. So nice that you have come.

1006
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
May I introduce my friends to you?

1007
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
If we're somehow getting in your way, you...

1008
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Come on, get out of here.

1009
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
ls she from Berlin?

1010
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Man, this is my aunt.

1011
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Go on, go!

1012
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Well.

1013
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Well now, there you are.

1014
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Yes, here I am.

1015
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,000
It's so nice of you to come.

1016
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
You've said that three times.

1017
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,000
No only twice.

1018
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Three times.

1019
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Fine, then you can start.

1020
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Of course you know that your big part is coming up

1021
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
in this comedy we are playing out here.

1022
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
You'll ask me whether or not I am crazy.

1023
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I will ignore your question as if it is unworthy of a response.

1024
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
The you will prove to me,

1025
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
that this whole thing is an outrageous farce

1026
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
and that a person can not become a child again,

1027
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
just by putting a pupil's cap on their head.

1028
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Then you will make it all too clear that in reality this is

1029
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
an escape, from the world, from you, and even from myself.

1030
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
That all of my opportunities in Berlin are fading away,

1031
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that my premiere is in danger and my publisher,

1032
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
and the minister of culture are upset and so on and so on...

1033
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
All quite true.

1034
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
But then I will answer you...

1035
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
in very brief fashion;  in fact, in only one sentence:

1036
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I feel pretty damn comfortable here.

1037
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
That is not the job of a poet.

1038
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
You said that quite beautifully.

1039
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
And you've gotten really fat too.

1040
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I've gotten younger.

1041
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
For Christmas you can give me a novel about the Wild West. And for Easter a basket of candy.

1042
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You're acting so silly.

1043
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
At any rate I have completely

1044
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
botched your big scene.

1045
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
You're wrong, my dear Hans.

1046
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I do my acting in the theater only,

1047
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:13,000
not in my private life... ...In my private life, I have other means.

1048
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:20,000
''May has arrived''

1049
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Do we have to walk past this place?

1050
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,000
This is not just a place, this is my school.

1051
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You'll have to allow me to enjoy this one last farewell look.

1052
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Ohh, see this gate here?

1053
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,000
There were so many mornings that I came waltzing through here,

1054
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
mostly with a bad conscience, and without my Latin.

1055
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
In the afternoons I would stroll back out,

1056
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,000
my stomach full of hunger and my head full of nonsense.

1057
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Can we move on please?

1058
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
When did the Western Goths conquer the...

1059
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,000
You hear that up there, on the corner? That's us.

1060
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
That is my class.

1061
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
We just had history with Doctor Brett, Na great guy.

1062
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Actually they are all great guys come to think of it.

1063
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Hey, we have a little break right now.

1064
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Come on.

1065
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Where to? Ohhh.

1066
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Marion, I just had a wonderful idea.

1067
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
You know what?  Why don't you go home alone.

1068
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'll stay here.

1069
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Come on!

1070
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
[Murmuring in the background]

1071
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
What a beauty.

1072
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
The "nose"!

1073
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Sit down.

1074
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You have been studying the great German poets.

1075
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Luck, go to the board and write down their names and the dates they lived.

1076
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Write big and clearly. You have plenty of room.

1077
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Where are you coming from so late... Oh!

1078
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
lt's nothing.

1079
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Just a bit of a bad toothache.

1080
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Here is my written excuse if you want to see it.

1081
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Wh- wh- why aren't you staying at home?

1082
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Well Professor, here I have more diversions.

1083
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,000
That's just great. Now, sit down...carefully.

1084
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
All of you could learn from Pfeiffer's example.

1085
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
How far have you gotten, Luck?

1086
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Why aren't you writing anymore?

1087
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
The board is full.

1088
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Well, turn it over.

1089
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I can't.  It's stuck.

1090
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Hmmm, let me show you.

1091
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Maybe I should erase this?

1092
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Go and get the principal.

1093
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
l have to say, I am very disappointed.

1094
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
To see this disgusting example of classroom disruption...

1095
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
in my school. I'm disappointed in all of you.

1096
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
l want to give the guilty student the opportunity,

1097
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
to voluntarily turn himself in .

1098
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
No!  Not here in front of the class. He'll have to come to my room.

1099
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
What do you want, Pfeiffer?

1100
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Well, Principal, you might get angry but I think the picture is really nice.

1101
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Pfeiffer! A young girl, probably from a proper family...

1102
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
and without any clothes on.

1103
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Yes, but Principal, I don't see it that way.

1104
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
This is no girl. It is supposed to be a boy.

1105
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
We're just not quite done with it yet.

1106
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Yes... in fact, I thought the same thing myself.

1107
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
But at any rate, I think it is extraordinarily nice...

1108
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
that this embarrassing incident

1109
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
has come to such an innocent resolution.

1110
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And from now on we will never speak about it again.

1111
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Ackermann, erase the board.

1112
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Where did we stop yesterday in our reading

1113
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
of "Don Carlos"?

1114
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Fourth act.

1115
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Let's read on with separate roles.

1116
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Who would like to take the part of the noble Marquis Posa?

1117
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Rosen is the right man for that role.

1118
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Good. Hosemann, you take the role of Princess Eboli.

1119
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
For God's sake, leave me...

1120
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
What did he say to you, you unfortunate one?

1121
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Nothing. Leave me alone, nothing.

1122
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
How much do you know? There is no escape for you now.

1123
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You will not tell anyone else about this in this lifetime.

1124
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Good God, what do you mean by that?

1125
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You don't want to..... kill me?

1126
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:40,000
ln fact I do.  I'll make it quick.

1127
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Oh, dear and eternal mercy. What error have I committed?

1128
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
If you don't mind?

1129
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Pfeiffer, you can't stay focused.

1130
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
What is this?

1131
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
It's a letter from a friend.

1132
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Then let's read it:

1133
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,000
"Look for me at the usual time and at the usual place."

1134
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
A thousand kisses...?

1135
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
Exclamation point.

1136
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Signed: "Big E? Period".

1137
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Who is that?

1138
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
But this has nothing to do with school.

1139
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
- Who is ''E Period''? - I won't tell you.

1140
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Fine. Then I'll have the principal determine whose handwriting this is.

1141
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Professor, may I just, for one second... Thank you.

1142
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Give me back the letter! Give me back the letter! Pfeiffer!

1143
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
We'll talk more about this.

1144
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
I'll expect you in my apartment at 3 o'clock.

1145
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Your teacher was expecting you...

1146
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
an hour ago. He is very angry.

1147
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
If you'll have a seat for just a moment, he'll be right in.

1148
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Pfeiffer, once again you are late.

1149
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
l asked for you to come at 3 o'clock.

1150
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
lt is just now 3.

1151
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Then your watch is wrong. It is two minutes past four.

1152
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Couldn't it be that your watch is wrong?

1153
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Oh, no it's not possible.  I'll prove it to you. You see...?

1154
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I don't understand this.

1155
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I'll have to get this repaired.

1156
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I'm afraid I treated you unjustly.

1157
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Have a seat.

1158
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
So, let's get to the reason for your visit.

1159
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
So, who is this "Big E Period"?

1160
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:19,000
- Or do you not wish to tell me? - Nein.

1161
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Very admirable, but it will not help you.

1162
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
l have already found out another way.

1163
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,000
I know you're going to be extremely angry with me and I know I'll probably fail my final exams...

1164
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
l am never angry with my students.

1165
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
That goes against my principles,

1166
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,000
which I have written about in my book, "the duty of a teacher..."

1167
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Yes, well, then can I go?

1168
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
One moment.

1169
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
You may well be an average student,

1170
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
but in spite of that you may be a very admirable human being.

1171
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:47,000
You havec caught the eye of and turned the head of an

1172
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
inexperienced young lady.

1173
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
You will no doubt destroy any possibilty there might have been...

1174
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,000
for you to have a secure and well-to-do life.

1175
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Are you ready to take the responsibility for that?

1176
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Well, I'll have to think about it.

1177
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
But, excuse me, Professor. I have another appointment.

1178
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Oh! May I?

1179
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Thank you very much. Good bye.

1180
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Poor Eva.

1181
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Tell me really quickly, what are you thinking about?

1182
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm not quite done with my thoughts just yet.

1183
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Are you afraid that you'll fail your final exam?

1184
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
There won't be any chance for that.

1185
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
- How is that? - I'm leaving. Probably pretty soon.

1186
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Hans! That's terrible. And what about me?

1187
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I'm taking you with me.

1188
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Oh, please tell me. Just how do you think that will happen?

1189
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Quite nicely. As my wife of course.

1190
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Oh Hans, you shouldn't joke about such things with me.

1191
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,000
l love you so terribly and I think you love me too,

1192
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
but we're both still going to school

1193
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
and we shouldn't be thinking about such things.

1194
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I'll be happy to wait for you.

1195
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
We are old enough.

1196
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
You're not so bright.

1197
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
You have to find a job.

1198
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
What can you do without a diploma?

1199
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Come on, let's think about it, OK?

1200
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Maybe an author. You don't need a diploma,

1201
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
you don't have to go to college and you can earn money rather quickly.

1202
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
You don't really think so?

1203
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
By the way, do you know my famous namesake,

1204
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
the famous author, Johannes Pfeiffer?

1205
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
The one with the "Novel of the Week"?

1206
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,000
But Hans, I would not compare you to him. He is a real poet.

1207
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,000
You could say that.

1208
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
That is wonderful.

1209
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
We were together quite a lot in Berlin.

1210
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
l know a few things about him.

1211
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
But Hans, now you're just bragging.

1212
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
Have you actually ever seen him?

1213
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
What does he look like?

1214
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Oh, pretty nice looking. He's built a little like me,

1215
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
His hair is a little bit longer and the glasses...

1216
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
You'll have to imagine me without glasses. This goof wears only a monocle.

1217
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Yes, and that face... How can I describe it, Eva?

1218
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
If you really want to know... ...then just look at me. Then you'll know how he looks

1219
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
What an imagination you have.

1220
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Not only do I look uncannily like this

1221
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,000
highly talented poet, but rather, in fact, I am he.

1222
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
What is that supposed to mean?

1223
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Just what I said. I am Johannes Pfeiffer.

1224
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Three weeks ago I won the Literature Award.

1225
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
My new comedy is playing at the Royal Playhouse.

1226
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Hold on. What is wrong with you? First you know him well, then you want to look like him...

1227
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
now you say you are him. You're too much today.

1228
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Seriously Eva, I swear to you.

1229
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
You have no tact. If you want to try an fool me, fine...

1230
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
but don't swear or invoke your word of honor.

1231
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
I can show you my identification. Ican introduce you to a woman from Berlin...

1232
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Fine then, if you want to.

1233
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
You don't need to get all upset.

1234
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
You have to believe me, trust me and marry me.

1235
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
But if you still believe that, I am nothing more than a poor student...

1236
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
then...then...

1237
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
- then? - then...

1238
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
...then someone else can have you.

1239
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Give me my coat please.

1240
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Here you are.

1241
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
- Bye. - Bye.

1242
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Have you done your geometry yet?

1243
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Nope. Did you? Hey, here comes Hans.

1244
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Hey, Hans, what's up? Why the long face?

1245
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
- Doesn't matter. - Wasn't she nice to you?

1246
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Stop talking like that.

1247
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Have you done the geometry?

1248
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
No, I'm leaving tomorrow.

1249
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Where to?

1250
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Back to Berlin.

1251
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You're just going to leave?

1252
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Tomorrow I'm going to turn in my resignation.

1253
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Tomorrow I'm going to do something,

1254
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
that will force them to throw me out.

1255
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
And then that will be the end.

1256
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Good night.

1257
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Yes, what is it?

1258
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:30,000
It's already 8 o'clock. Don't you have school today?

1259
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
But it's only 7.

1260
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Seven? No, it was 7 some time ago.

1261
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
For goodness sake!

1262
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,000
This is the fault of that disrespectful snit...

1263
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
- Look out!! The "nose" is coming! - Oh, the "nose"...

1264
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
He'll be coming a little bit later today.

1265
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
As far as I'm concerned he can stay at home...

1266
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Don't talk like that. Girls have ruined me.

1267
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
You already have one.

1268
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Should I get the girls to come over here?

1269
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
- What? - How?

1270
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Right. Follow me.

1271
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
What? That's just...

1272
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
He's gone crazy.

1273
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Hey you, come here.

1274
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Run on over to the girls school.

1275
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Tell the principal that our principal says hello.

1276
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
And then tell her the following:

1277
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Today we are having a man come to our chemistry class,

1278
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,000
who is going to show us radium. - a man who is going to show us radium.

1279
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And ask her whether she wouldn't like

1280
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
to send over her older classes,

1281
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,000
so that the girls could see that. Understood? - Yes! - Now go on!

1282
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:03,000
"TEACHERS ONLY"

1283
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Is it OK that we're here?

1284
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
It's always OK for you to be here.

1285
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
So what do we do now?

1286
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I don't know. Knebel, talk to them.

1287
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
What should I say?

1288
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Where is the man with the Radio?

1289
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
The man who is going to show us the radio. I mean the radium.

1290
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Radium? Oh yes, him! Yes, well, he'll be here soon.

1291
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Don't you have a teacher?

1292
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Pfeiffer said that the "nose" won't be here today...

1293
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Where is Pfeiffer?

1294
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
He's not here today.

1295
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:58,000
You're burning my mouth.

1296
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
You could get up on time.

1297
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
You certainly have enough clocks.

1298
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
ln my entire life I have never been late.

1299
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
With the exception of today.

1300
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Sit down please.

1301
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You should all have a seat.

1302
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Ladies, I thank you for such a joyous reception,

1303
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
and I believe, that I am liked better by you than

1304
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
by my own students.

1305
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Unfortunately today I am running late,

1306
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,000
and according to the principles of my

1307
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
often mentioned book: "The rights of a teacher...

1308
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
taking into consideration the institution of higher learning...''

1309
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,000
must not differ from those which exist for the students.

1310
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Ackermann, write this down in the class book:

1311
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Professor "Nose" will receive one hour detention...

1312
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,000
because of his unexcused tardiness.

1313
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,000
We will be very brief.

1314
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Professor Kray has been chosen for a position as principal

1315
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
in another school.

1316
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
l would just like to be personally observe...

1317
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
his teaching methods.

1318
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Superintendent, that will be just fine.

1319
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
In fact Professor Kray has chemistry right now with his Upper School class.

1320
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
If you would like to go and sit in...

1321
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
l would like to.

1322
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
What are you doing? Don't you want to come and see?

1323
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Take it easy.  Just because the superintendent is here...

1324
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You know, Kray is to be envied for this principal's position,

1325
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
in spite of his sometimes unique teaching methods.

1326
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Now, your methods are also sometimes unique.

1327
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
So don't you want to let your old colleague know...

1328
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
which methods, in your opinion...

1329
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
are the correct methods?

1330
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
- Mine. - Aha.

1331
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
When is exactly a method correct?

1332
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
- When the teacher becomes the friend of his pupils? - Yes.

1333
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
...and the pupils respect him.

1334
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Unfortunately no.

1335
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
This new age has new methods.

1336
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Yes, you young teachers always want to make things better...

1337
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
and you will!

1338
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
l'm too old for any new methods.

1339
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Dear Pömmel - Excuse me, Professor...

1340
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Oh please, just call me Pömmel.

1341
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Young trees have to be bound,

1342
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
so they can grow properly,

1343
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
and so that they don't sprout and bloom in every direction.

1344
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
And that is just how it is with young people.

1345
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Discipline has to be the tie that binds them.

1346
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
So that they grow to a beautiful maturity.

1347
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Don't you worry,

1348
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:49,000
that your trees will grow right up into the sky?

1349
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
No, never.  Life takes care of that.

1350
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Have you noticed that too?

1351
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Radium...radium is a divalent element...

1352
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
...which has the property of being luminescent in the dark.

1353
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
And now I will show you,

1354
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
but for this demonstration it has to be completely dark.

1355
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Ackermann, go to the windows and pull the curtains.

1356
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Please, please, do not let us interupt you.

1357
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
You were just making a little joke?

1358
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Science spiced with humor.

1359
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Carry on with the lesson.

1360
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Please carry on.

1361
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Pfeiffer, for heaven's sake.

1362
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Please keep up this charade.

1363
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Don't worry.  You won't be punished. I give you my word.

1364
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Please, please.

1365
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,000
So, now where were we?

1366
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
The chemistry of farm soil.

1367
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Friedrich the Great had already recognized the problem.

1368
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
It is from him that we have the saying:

1369
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,000
"He who makes it possible for two stalks to grow,

1370
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:36,000
where there was previously only one

1371
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
is greater than the greatest military general."

1372
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Another example: again, it was a German,

1373
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
who through his scientific research,

1374
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
laid the foundation for...

1375
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,000
our modern day agricultural chemistry.

1376
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,000
We can call him the father of fertilizer.

1377
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,000
He studied in Giessen, he discovered chlorinated chloroform,

1378
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
created new techniques for analysis.

1379
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,000
He has become more well known

1380
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
because his name has been associated with a popular meat extract.

1381
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
So, what is this chemist's name?

1382
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Maggi! I mean Liebig.

1383
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Where did these young girls come from?

1384
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
The girls, well, yes...

1385
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
This is the Upper School class of the girl's school next door.

1386
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Ohhh, you are experimenting with a co-educational system.

1387
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Very modern, and not bad.

1388
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Please keep me informed of your results.

1389
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:36,000
Teacher, very, very nice.

1390
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Please, carry on.

1391
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Nice. Very good, Ackermann.A-/B+.

1392
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Have a seat.

1393
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Pfeiffer, carry on.

1394
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Where is he hiding himself?

1395
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
He is absent.

1396
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Pity.  Too bad, too bad. Superintendent.

1397
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
l would have so much liked to have introduced you to the

1398
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
biggest hooligan in our school.

1399
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:16,000
That's fine, no need. You can expect very soon...

1400
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
a glowing report from us.

1401
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
l thought his lesson was just excellent,

1402
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
very fresh and original.

1403
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
We can go now.

1404
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
You disrespectful jerk!

1405
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Let him through.

1406
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I'll kick you out of this class.

1407
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Ackermann, call the police!

1408
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Luck, call the fire department!

1409
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Principal, you see now!

1410
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Pardon me gentlemen. I have a question.

1411
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Which one of you is the real Professor Kray?

1412
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
l am, Superintendent.  It's obvious.

1413
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
l am, Superintendent, because I was here earlier.

1414
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
It's probably better if we just let the gentlemen work this out.

1415
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Principal, let me know when I can come back.

1416
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
I'll be expecting your report.

1417
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Principal, we can make this short and sweet. You won't have to say one unfriendly word.

1418
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
You will want to throw me out.

1419
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I agree that you should. I worked it out this way.

1420
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
I've earned it, I planned on it.

1421
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
No. no Pfeiffer.  It is much worse than that.

1422
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
I can't do anything to you. I can't punish you in any way.

1423
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
l have given you my word on that.

1424
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
What!? You mean I can't leave yet?

1425
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
What does someone have to do to get kicked out of this school?

1426
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
A murder?

1427
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
...or lead your daughter astray?

1428
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Yes, Hans, you can!

1429
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,000
I'll stand by your side whether you have a diploma or not.

1430
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
Oh Papa, we want to become authors.

1431
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
- Then you'll both starve. - It doesn't matter We'll get through it, won't we, Hans.

1432
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
I've done it.

1433
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:06,000
l'm leaving and I get to keep my Eva.

1434
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Me, the pupil, Hans Pfeiffer.

1435
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
By the way, I almost forgot:

1436
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Here is my High School Diploma...

1437
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,000
here is my PhD diploma, my literary award,

1438
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
and this you will find especially interesting,

1439
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
my dear father-in-law,

1440
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
the last paycheck from my publisher

1441
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
and my income tax return.

1442
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
If he really is the author,

1443
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
then maybe he'll write a novel about us.

1444
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Maybe an unseemly film?

1445
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Gentlemen, it's already been done.

1446
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
But don't worry.

1447
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
l have exaggerated everything so much,

1448
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
that nobody will be recognizable.

1449
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Besides, a high school like the one you have here

1450
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
with teachers like you, and with students like us

1451
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
doesn't even exist.

1452
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
l confess publically,

1453
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:17,000
that I made up the entire story from A-Z,

1454
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
the school, the principal, the teachers and even little Eva.

1455
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Yes, I even made up my own part.

1456
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,000
The only true part of the entire story is the beginning:

1457
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
The Fire Tong Bowl.

1458
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
The only true things are our memories that we carry with us,

1459
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,000
the dreams that we spin

1460
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
and the desires, which drive us.

1461
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
These are the things that should keep us content...
